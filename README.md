# Coursera Course: Final Project Assessment - Little Lemon Restaurant App

## Learning Objectives

The assessment's learning objectives include:

1. **Fetching Data from the Network:**
   - Demonstrate the ability to retrieve data from a remote server.
   - Use appropriate libraries and tools to handle network requests and responses.

2. **Storing Data in a Database:**
   - Create and manage a database to store fetched data.
   - Implement database tables to store structured data.

3. **Extracting Data for Use:**
   - Query the database to retrieve stored data.
   - Use data access objects (DAOs) to interact with the database.

4. **Presenting Data in an Android App:**
   - Display the retrieved data in a user-friendly manner.
   - Use Android components such as RecyclerView, TextView, etc., to present data.

5. **Manipulating Data Presentation:**
   - Implement dynamic UI updates based on data changes.
   - Ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Final Project: Little Lemon Restaurant App

In this final project, you will work on an app for the Little Lemon restaurant. The project will involve:

1. **Fetching Menu Data:**
   - Retrieve menu items from a remote server using network calls.
   - Parse the JSON response and map it to appropriate data classes.

2. **Storing Menu Data:**
   - Save the fetched menu items into a local database.
   - Ensure the database structure aligns with the data model.

3. **Displaying Menu Data:**
   - Create a user interface to display the menu items.
   - Use RecyclerView to list the items in a visually appealing format.

4. **Observing Data Changes:**
   - Implement LiveData to observe changes in the database.
   - Update the UI dynamically when the data changes.

5. **Ensuring Data Persistence:**
   - Ensure that the app works offline by using the local database.
   - Implement necessary error handling for network failures.

By completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to fetch, store, extract, and present data within an Android app, effectively showcasing your understanding of the course's core concepts.
